AI Glass Cutting Video Prompts

Glass Effect with Sounds

A hyper-realistic cinematic close-up of a whole, full-shaped [fruit or vegetable] made of transparent glass with a soft light-colored outer hue — for example, pale yellow for a banana, light red for an apple, gentle orange for a carrot. The glass fruit is perfectly centered on a wooden cutting board, glowing subtly under studio lighting. A human hand is clearly visible, holding a sharp stainless steel knife just above the fruit, ready to slice. In slow motion, the knife makes the first clean slice through the glass fruit — the front section breaks off cleanly with delicate glass-crack sounds. Then, the knife immediately makes a second slice, cutting another piece smoothly. Transparent shards scatter lightly from both cuts. ASMR slicing sounds only — no talking, no music. Only the hand, knife, and fruit are visible. Ultra-sharp macro lens, shallow depth of field, cinematic lighting, 1280x720 resolution, 30 FPS.

✅ Just Replace [fruit or vegetable] with what you want: banana, onion, carrot, etc. [No Need of Chatgpt]

Jelly Glass Effect with Sounds

A hyper-realistic cinematic close-up of a whole, full-shaped [fruit or vegetable] made of transparent jelly glass with a soft light-colored outer hue — for example, pale yellow for a banana, light red for an apple, gentle orange for a carrot. The glass fruit is perfectly centered on a wooden cutting board, glowing subtly under studio lighting. A human hand is clearly visible, holding a sharp stainless steel knife just above the fruit, ready to slice. In slow motion, the knife makes the first clean slice through the glass fruit — the front section breaks off cleanly with delicate jelly-crack sounds. Then, the knife immediately makes a second slice, cutting another piece smoothly. Transparent shards scatter lightly from both cuts. ASMR slicing sounds only — no talking, no music. Only the hand, knife, and fruit are visible. Ultra-sharp macro lens, shallow depth of field, cinematic lighting, 1280x720 resolution, 30 FPS.
